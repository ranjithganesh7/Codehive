# 🛡️ CODEHIVE’25 – 3rd Place Winning Project

We are proud to share that our team secured **3rd Place 🥉** at **CODEHIVE’25**, the premier hackathon hosted by **Vel Tech Multi Tech**! This project showcases a cutting-edge cybersecurity solution that leverages **Moving Target Defense (MTD)** techniques and an advanced **Reverse Shell & Backdoor Detection System**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Our solution is built in **two powerful stages**:

---

### 💡 Stage 1: Moving Target Defense (MTD)

We tackled the challenge of static cybersecurity architectures by introducing a dynamic, multi-layered MTD system:

#### ✅ Network-Level MTD
- **IP Shuffling**: Periodically changes the system's IP address to disrupt attacker reconnaissance.
- **Port Shuffling**: Dynamically rotates open ports to evade port-scanning tools.

#### ✅ Application-Level MTD
- **Code Randomization**: Alters the code structure in runtime, making memory-based attacks ineffective.

#### ✅ Data-Level MTD
- **Dynamic Encryption**: Changes encryption keys and algorithms on the fly.
- **Storage Shuffling**: Periodically moves data across different storage blocks to increase unpredictability.

### 🛡 Stage 2: Reverse Shell & Backdoor Detection System

A robust detection and defense system designed to **identify and respond to real-time threats**:

#### ✅ Process Monitoring
- Detects unauthorized and suspicious processes.
- Implements automated process termination for identified threats.

#### ✅ Outbound Connection Tracker
- Scans outbound traffic to detect **Command-and-Control (C2)** server communications.
- Alerts or blocks anomalous network behavior.

#### ✅ Memory & Packet Inspection
- Deep scans running memory for known backdoor signatures.
- Analyzes network packets for hidden payloads or malicious intent.

#### ✅ Attacker Redirection
- Neutralizes malware installations by **reversing payloads back to the attacker's system**, effectively turning the tables.
